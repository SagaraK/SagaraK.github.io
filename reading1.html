   Question 1: What if a good working defintion of what a System is and perhaps what it is not?

   <p class="tab">A system is a group of elements or parts and their interactions/relationship with each other
   A system is not a singular object with no relations.</p>

   Question 2: For the 4 system definitions you were to look up please give in your own words what they mean and give an example of them for each case.

   <p class="tab">Modularity: A system having the ability to adapt and have different parts to continue functioning. There is flexability in how system can be organized. An example of this is Legos.</p>
   <p class="tab">Decomposability: The breaking down of a system into fundamental parts. An example of this is a Matroshyka doll.
   <p class="tab">Emergence: The micro level of a system functioning towards a greater or larger goal. An exmaple of this is gears, construction, or electronics(circuit boards).</p>
   <p class="tab">Chaos Theory: The non linear or seemingly random output from initial inputs. An example of this is climate change or survival of the fittest.</p>

  Question 3: What is the difference between ideas of Modularity and Tesselation? What are the properties that are in oppostion with each other?

  <p class="tab">The main differences are to do with the rigidity and uniformity of the system. Tesselations are rigid and highly repeatable. Modularity are flexible and highly adaptable.</p>

  Question 4: What is the difference between designing something that has Complexity (aperiodic) vs being Uniform (periodic)?

  <p class="tab">The difference resides in the process. Complex design typically has varying results while uniform have the same pattern, resulting in the same outcome.</p>

  Question 5: What is the difference between a system diagram and a some kind of feature diagram like a like a exploded view drawing or a illustration like this lady bug.

  <p class="tab">Exploded view drawing explains the parts of an object rather than the system and purpose
   A system diagram gives information about each part of a system and their interactions. They also revolve background
   the conceptual nature of an ecosystem as opposed to the specific details of each part.</p>
