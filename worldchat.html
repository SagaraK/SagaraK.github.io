    "Left Out", Website<br>
    The internet is a place where one can turn to when they are feeling lonely or perhaps deprived of any sort
    of human connection. Yet, what if one can not find their place on the internet?
    What if they attempts to find that human connection becomes a situation where no one cares about who you are?
    "Left Out" brings lift of this issue that the internet has where even if you talking to someone, without that face to face interaction,
    you can never really be sure if they truly are listening to you.<br>
