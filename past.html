    "Regrets", Website <br>
    This piece focuses on the idea of the past holding us back from the present. While many of us
    go about daily lives acting as if everything is alright, we know at the back of our mind that
    there are regrets that we can not foreget. When we think of those regrets, time seems to be moving
    at a snail's pace and it is a neverending cycle of a destructive game that destroys how one lives their life.
