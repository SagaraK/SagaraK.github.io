    In a world where social media has become a dominant force in our lives, how much time do we actully
    spend on each platform mindlessly? We have become so obssessed with what is going on in other people's
    lives that we often forget that our reality is something not to be looked down upon with negligence.
    Think about how many hour you spend on Twitter or Youtube. Now, on this site, for every hour, press the button once
    and think about what that means. <br>
