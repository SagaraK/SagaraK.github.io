        My name is Kevin Sagara and what my goal is to bring awareness to issues
        regarding behavior towards the internet and technology. In a time where
        technology is becoming a greater part of our lives, it is important to
        acknowledge the problems and controversies that surround that. <br>
        I am trying to accomplish this goal by showing common scenes when
        browsing the internet in our daily lives. If this work is not relatable,
        especially for the internet, then the message will be ignored by many
        users because it is not realistic and/or too negative. I want to explore
        both positives and negatives of technology because it is important to note
        the growth and benefits rather than focusing on the nefarious intentions.
