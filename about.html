        My name is Kevin Sagara - through my work within digital media and emerging technologies, I am seeking to enhance the relationship between modern technology and our present society. Throughout the years technology has become increasingly commonplace in our lives and as it continues to engulf our world, it is important to better understand the implications that come with such an environment.Thus, being able to identify and understanding how technology is used to better lives and the world is now more than ever becoming an essential quality. As a result, my aims are to explore the future relationship technology will hold with humans as innovation continues to inevitably spread through our daily lives. Creating work through digital mediums, such as videos and websites, allows me to spread awareness about the negatives and positives of having developed technology in modern society. The positives I focus on involve increasing the knowledge level of communities that are at a disadvantage through the growing accessibility of technology and promoting others to see how art can be made through mechanical means. However, I want to also analyze the negative social effects that having technology can have. For instance, the mental health issues that online communities can worsen through methods of bullying or increased amount of time on social media leading to insecurities is something that has to be taught for future generations. <br><br>
          Furthermore, I also aspire to emphasize the potential ramifications technology has over our environment, relationships, and both our public and private lives. The rapid rise of the internet has allowed for worldwide connections to be made with people all over the world spanning multitudes of different subjects and interests. One of these that is becoming increasingly important is environmental change through the development of technology. While technology is being used to analyze trends in nature and allowing for preventative measures to be made against climate change, innovations also require the Earth's natural resources in order for technology to be developed upon. This conundrum is something my work revolves around as it is an important question that needs to be addressed and talked about. <br><br>
While my primary focus is in digital media, I am also capable of using more traditional methods, such as sculpture, to further portray my message. My inspiration for this matter comes from my history and large interest with developing technologies, such as the usage of virtual reality becoming accessible to the common people, and how that can enhance, or diminish, our own experiences for example.  For me, the emergence of VR and virtual worlds has played a significant role in my interest in creating digital media work because of how it can be used to benefit society. It is easier for people to understand what is happening when it is visually in front of them as opposed to information spreading through mouth to mouth. That is why in the future of my career as a digital media artist, using these technologies will become no doubt a powerful tool in my journey.
