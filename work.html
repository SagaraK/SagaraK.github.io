    "Untitled", Website <br>
This piece is is meant for the user to experience their own personality
and reactions to the idea of obedience in terms of using the internet.
The internet, while extremely helpful, seems to dull our observational
senses and we often go through media believing everything with little to
no doubts. The goal of this website it to understand on a greater level and
question the content that is being presented. </h3>;

      "Silhouettes of Emotions", Digital Video, 2min <br>
    This is a commentary about how there are many in society who hide their true
     emotions, rather than displaying their authentic self. The silhouettes are
     placed on each side of the pillar because those "fake" emotions are being
      used to build a character or personality that one uses when in public.
       The sound of a distorted clock in the background is being used to show how
        much time we worry about our appearance in public and how that reality just
         does not feel real or natural.

        "Incognito", Digital Video, 4min <br>
        This is a commentary on the information overload and hidden identity
        people have when browsing the internet. We spent countless time looking
        through our daily websites without really thinking about what the internet
        is really doing to us. Everyone is hidden behind the computer screen
        and toxic behavior can ensure behind that anonymity.
